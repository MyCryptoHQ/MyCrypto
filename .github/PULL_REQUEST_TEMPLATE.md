## Quality Assurance

- [ ] The branch name is in lowercase-kebab-case with no prefix (unless it was created from Clubhouse)
- [ ] The base branch is develop or gau (no nested branches)
- [ ] This is related to a maximum of one Clubhouse story or GitHub issue
- [ ] Types are safe (avoid TypeScript/TSLint features like any and disable, instead use more specific types)
- [ ] If code is copied from existing directories, there is an explanation of why this is necesary in the description/changes, and all copying is done in separate commits to make them easy to filter out
- [ ] If your code adds new text to the UI, the added text is [translatable](https://github.com/MyCryptoHQ/MyCrypto/wiki/Contributing---Translatable-strings)
