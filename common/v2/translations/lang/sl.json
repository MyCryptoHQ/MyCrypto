		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_FIVE_ANSWER": "The MyCrypto DeFiZap integration uses the same process as the DeFiZap.com process. MyCrypto’s DeFiZap integration adds an extra layer of convenience by allowing you to access Zaps without having to leave MyCrypto. For the full list of available Zaps, visit [DeFiZap.com](https://defizap.com).",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_FOUR": "Which Zaps are available?",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_ONE": "What is DeFi?",

		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SEVEN": "How do I see my DeFiZap balances?",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SEVEN_ANSWER": "Due to technical limitations, at this time we’re only currently able to give an estimate on some Zap balances, and DeFiZap recommends checking [pools.fyi](https://pools.fyi/) to view some of your balances/returns. Over time, as we and DeFiZap explore this further, we anticipate that there will be a better solution for this.",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SIX": "After entering a Zap, how do I exit?",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SIX_ANSWER": "To exit a Zap, please visit [DeFiZap.com](https://defizap.com), go to the Zap that you’re currently engaged with, and follow the steps that they outline.",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_THREE": "Which protocols does DeFiZap interact with and where can I learn about them?",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_TWO": "Is DeFiZap safe?",
		"DEFIZAP_QUESTION_TWO_ANSWER": "There's always risk when interacting with DeFi and smart contracts, and DeFiZap is an experimental project that is in beta. Using a service like DeFiZap to interact with protocols for you does add a small amount of additional risk, but most of the risk stems from the actual protocols that are being interacted with.",
		"DEFI_DESC_FIRST": "Zaps are created by none other than [DeFiZap](https://www.defizap.com)! With the intent to help users gain access to decentralized finance (“DeFi”) protocols, DeFiZap takes complicated processes and turns them into one-click solutions.",
		"DEFI_DESC_SECOND": "In addition to this easy entry into otherwise complicated DeFi protocols, it’s all noncustodial. You retain complete control of your funds and can manage everything manually if you’d like.",
