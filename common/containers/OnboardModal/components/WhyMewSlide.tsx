        If you don't like the sound of this, consider using [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) or
        [Blockchain.info](https://blockchain.info/wallet/#/signup). They have more familiar accounts
        with usernames &amp; passwords.

        If you are scared but want to use MEW, [get a hardware
        wallet](https://myetherwallet.github.io/knowledge-base/hardware-wallets/hardware-wallet-recommendations.html)!
        These keep your keys secure.
