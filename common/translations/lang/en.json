    "HELP_21_Desc_5": "And YES, in theory you could just type in a string of 64 hexadecimal characters until you got one that matched. In fact, smart people could write a program to very quickly check random private keys. This is known as \"brute-forcing\" or \"mining\" private keys. People have thought about this long and hard. With a few very high end servers, they may be able to check 1M+ keys / second. However, even checking that many per second would not yield access to make the cost of running those servers even close to worthwhile - it is more likely you, and your great-grandchildren, will die before getting a match.

    "HELP_21_Desc_8": "Of course, this all assumes that keys are generated in a truly random way & with sufficient entropy. The keys generated here meet that criteria, as do Jaxx and Mist/geth. The Ethereum wallets are all pretty good. Keys generated by brainwallets do not, as a person's brain is not capable of creating a truly random seed. There have been a number of other issues regarding lack of entropy or seeds not being generated in a truly random way in Bitcoin-land, but that's a separate issue that can wait for another day. ",
