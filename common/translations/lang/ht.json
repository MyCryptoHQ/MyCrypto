In fact, smart people could write a program to very quickly check random private keys. This is known as \"brute-forcing\" or \"mining\" private keys. People have thought about this long and hard. With a few very high end servers, they may be able to check 1M+ keys / second. However, even checking that many per second would not yield access to make the cost of running those servers even close to worthwhile - it is more likely you, and your great-grandchildren, will die before getting a match.

There have been a number of other issues regarding lack of entropy or seeds not being generated in a truly random way in Bitcoin-land, but that's a separate issue that can wait for another day. ",
