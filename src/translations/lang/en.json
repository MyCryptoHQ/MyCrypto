MyCrypto’s Zapper integration adds an extra layer of convenience by allowing you to access Zaps without having to leave MyCrypto. For the full list of available Zaps, visit [Zapper.fi](https://www.zapper.fi).",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_FOUR": "Which Zaps are available?",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_ONE": "What is DeFi?",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_ONE_ANSWER": "Short for decentralized finance, DeFi refers to financial services for crypto, such as borrowing, lending, and trading, that are usually facilitated using smart contracts on the blockchain. They are often open-source and noncustodial.",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SEVEN": "How do I see my Zapper balances?",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SEVEN_ANSWER": "Due to technical limitations, at this time we’re only currently able to give an estimate on some Zap balances, and Zapper recommends checking [pools.fyi](https://pools.fyi/) to view some of your balances/returns. Over time, as we and Zapper explore this further, we anticipate that there will be a better solution for this.",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_SIX": "After entering a Zap, how do I exit?",

    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_THREE": "Which protocols does Zapper interact with and where can I learn about them?",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_TWO": "Is Zapper safe?",
    "DEFIZAP_QUESTION_TWO_ANSWER": "There's always risk when interacting with DeFi and smart contracts, and Zapper is an experimental project that is in beta. Using a service like Zapper to interact with protocols for you does add a small amount of additional risk, but most of the risk stems from the actual protocols that are being interacted with.",
    "DEFI_DESC_FIRST": "Zaps are created by none other than [Zapper.fi](https://www.zapper.fi)! With the intent to help users gain access to decentralized finance (“DeFi”) protocols, Zapper takes complicated processes and turns them into one-click solutions.",
