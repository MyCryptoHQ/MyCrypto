# MyEtherWallet V4+ (ALPHA - VISIT [V3](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet) for the production site)

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

#### Run:

```bash
npm run dev # run app in dev mode
```

#### Build:

```bash
npm run build # build app
```

It generates app in `dist` folder.

#### Test:

```bash
npm run test # run tests with Jest
```

#### Dev (HTTPS):

1. Create your own SSL Certificate (Heroku has a [nice guide here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self))
2. Move the `.key` and `.crt` files into `webpack_config/server.*`
3. Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev:https
```

#### Derivation Check:
##### The derivation checker utility assumes that you have:
1. Docker installed/available
2. [dternyak/eth-priv-to-addr](https://hub.docker.com/r/dternyak/eth-priv-to-addr/) pulled from DockerHub

##### Docker setup instructions:
1. Install docker (on macOS, [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) is suggested)
2. `docker pull dternyak/eth-priv-to-addr`

##### Run Derivation Checker
```bash
npm run derivation-checker
```

## Style Guides and Philosophies

The following are guides for developers to follow for writing compliant code.


### Redux and Actions

Each reducer has one file in `reducers/[namespace].ts` that contains the reducer
and initial state, one file in `actions/[namespace].ts` that contains the action
creators and their return types, and optionally one file in
`sagas/[namespace].ts` that handles action side effects using
[`redux-saga`](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).

The files should be laid out as follows:

#### Reducer

* State should be explicitly defined and exported
* Initial state should match state typing, define every key

```ts
import { NamespaceAction } from "actions/[namespace]";
import { TypeKeys } from 'actions/[namespace]/constants';

export interface State { /* definition for state object */ };
export const INITIAL_STATE: State = { /* Initial state shape */ };

export function [namespace](
	state: State = INITIAL_STATE,
	action: NamespaceAction
): State {
	switch (action.type) {
		case TypeKeys.NAMESPACE_NAME_OF_ACTION:
			return {
				...state,
				// Alterations to state
			};		  
		default:
			return state;
	}
}
```

#### Actions
* Define each action creator in `actionCreator.ts`
* Define each action object type in `actionTypes.ts`
    * Export a union of all of the action types for use by the reducer
* Define each action type as a string enum in `constants.ts`  
* Export `actionCreators` and `actionTypes` from module file `index.ts`  

```
├── common
    ├── actions - application actions
        ├── [namespace] - action namespace
            ├── actionCreators.ts - action creators
            ├── actionTypes.ts - action interfaces / types
            ├── constants.ts - string enum
            ├── index.ts - exports all action creators and action object types
```
##### constants.ts
```ts
export enum TypeKeys {
  NAMESPACE_NAME_OF_ACTION = 'NAMESPACE_NAME_OF_ACTION'
}
```
##### actionTypes.ts
```ts
/*** Name of action ***/
export interface NameOfActionAction {
	type: TypeKeys.NAMESPACE_NAME_OF_ACTION,
	/* Rest of the action object shape */
};

/*** Action Union ***/
export type NamespaceAction =
	| ActionOneAction
	| ActionTwoAction
	| ActionThreeAction;
```
##### actionCreators.ts
```ts
import * as interfaces from './actionTypes';
import { TypeKeys } from './constants';

export interface TNameOfAction = typeof nameOfAction;
export function nameOfAction(): interfaces.NameOfActionAction {
	return {
		type: TypeKeys.NAMESPACE_NAME_OF_ACTION,
		payload: {}
	};
};
```
##### index.ts
```ts
export * from './actionCreators';
export * from './actionTypes';
```

### Typing Redux-Connected Components

Components that receive props directly from redux as a result of the `connect`
function should use AppState for typing, rather than manually defining types.
This makes refactoring reducers easier by catching mismatches or changes of
types in components, and reduces the chance for inconsistency. It's also less
code overall.

```
// Do this
import { AppState } from 'reducers';

interface Props {
	wallet: AppState['wallet']['inst'];
	rates: AppState['rates']['rates'];
	// ...
}

// Not this
import { IWallet } from 'libs/wallet';
import { Rates } from 'libs/rates';

interface Props {
	wallet: IWallet;
	rates: Rates;
	// ...
}
```

However, if you have a sub-component that takes in props from a connected
component, it's OK to manually specify the type. Especially if you go from
being type-or-null to guaranteeing the prop will be passed (because of a
conditional render.)

### Higher Order Components

#### Typing Injected Props
Props made available through higher order components can be tricky to type. Normally, if a component requires a prop, you add it to the component's interface and it just works. However, working with injected props from [higher order components](https://medium.com/@DanHomola/react-higher-order-components-in-typescript-made-simple-6f9b55691af1), you will be forced to supply all required props whenever you compose the component.  

```ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  countryCode?: string;
  routerLocation: { pathname: string };
}

...

class OtherComponent extends React.Component<{}, {}> {
  render() {
    return (
      <MyComponent
        name="foo"
        countryCode="CA"
        // Error: 'routerLocation' is missing!
        />
    );
  }
```

Instead of tacking the injected props on the MyComponentProps interface, put them in another interface called `InjectedProps`:

```ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
  countryCode?: string;
}

interface InjectedProps  {
  routerLocation: { pathname: string };
}
```

Now add a [getter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) to cast `this.props` as the original props - `MyComponentProps` and the injected props - `InjectedProps`:

```ts
class MyComponent extends React.Component<MyComponentProps, {}> {
  get injected() {
    return this.props as MyComponentProps & InjectedProps;
  }

  render() {
    const { name, countryCode, routerLocation } = this.props;
    ...
  }
}
```

## Event Handlers

Event handlers such as `onChange` and `onClick`, should be properly typed. For example, if you have an event listener on an input element inside a form:
```ts
public onValueChange = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (this.props.onChange) {
      this.props.onChange(
        e.currentTarget.value,
        this.props.unit
      );
    }
  };
```
Where you type the event as a `React.FormEvent` of type `HTML<TYPE>Element`.

## Class names

Dynamic class names should use the `classnames` module to simplify how they are created instead of using string template literals with expressions inside.

### Styling

Legacy styles are housed under `common/assets/styles` and written with LESS.
However, going forward, each styled component should create a a `.scss` file of
the same name in the same folder, and import it like so:

```ts
import React from "react";

import "./MyComponent.scss";

export default class MyComponent extends React.component<{}, {}> {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="MyComponent">
				<div className="MyComponent-child">Hello!</div>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

These style modules adhere to [SuitCSS naming convention](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md):

```scss
.MyComponent {
	/* Styles */

	&-child {
		/* Styles */

		&.is-hidden {
			display: none;
		}
	}
}
```

All elements inside of a component should extend its parent class namespace, or
create a new namespace (Potentially breaking that out into its own component.)

Variables and mixins can be imported from the files in `common/styles`:

```scss
@import "sass/colors";

code {
	color: $code-color;
}
```

#### Converting Styles

When working on a module that has styling in Less, try to do the following:

* Screenshot the component in question
* Create a new SCSS file in the same directory
* Remove styling from LESS file, convert it to the SCSS file (Mostly s/@/$)
* Convert class names to SuitCSS naming convention
* Convert any utility classes from `etherewallet-utilities.less` into mixins
* Convert as many element selectors to class name selectors as possible
* Convert as many `<br/>` tags or `&nbsp;`s to margins
* Ensure that there has been little to no deviation from screenshot
