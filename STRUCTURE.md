├── features - Related chunks of application functionality.
|   ├── Feature - An individual feature.
|   |   ├── Subfeature - A nested feature that acts as a piece of the feature.
|   |   ├── Feature.tsx - The primary component encapsulating the feature; typically the landing page of a route.

|   ├── Service - An individual service.
|   |   ├── Service.ts - The class file for the service.
|   |   ├── constants.ts - Single-use configuration variables only used for the service. If used elsewhere, it should be moved to the global directory.

## Providers

* `Providers` are special React components that are used to provide functionality potentially many layers deep, while avoiding prop-drilling.
* Each Provider file exports a constant (e.g. `const ExampleContext = React.createContext()`), as well as a class.
* The class contains a state variable that includes all variables and functions to be accessed down the hierarchy. _Functions are placed in state._
* In the render method of the class, `this.props.children` is returned inside of (e.g. `<ExampleContext.Provider value={this.state} />).
* When `Service` modules need to interact with UI across features, they should use a `Provider`, and communicate changes through state (e.g. ExampleProvider should use an ExampleContext).
* Providers should be placed in the `Layout` feature, wrapping all other components.

## Services

* `Service` modules are business-layer-logic classes that encapsulate interactions with a particular entity.
* The API service module is used to interact with external servers to gather information.
* The Storage and Cache service modules are used to interact with local storage, to aid in persisting data.
* Services should export an abstract class, containing the functionality, as a named export.
* Services should default-export a singleton class which prevents other classes from being instantiated.

## Indexing

* Every level of directory should contain an `index.ts` file which re-exports everything in the directory, recursively.
* Externally interfacing with a directory should always be done with the most senior index file (e.g. `import { Foo } from 'v2/components';` vs. `import Foo from 'v2/components/Foo/Foo';`)
* Internally interfacing with a directory should always be done with relative pathing `../../`.
